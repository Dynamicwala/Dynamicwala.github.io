Born on 2nd October 1869, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is revered as Father of the Nation for his immense sacrifices for India. He not only ushered India towards freedom, but he also became the inspiring figure for many independence struggles and rights movements across the world. Popularly called Bapu, Gandhi introduced the doctrine of non-violence in India. According to him, independence was to be achieved through a combination of non-violent movement and non-co-operation with the British. His credit lies in the fact that he was able to bring the masses into the freedom struggle. The historic Non-Cooperation movement, Dandi March and the Quit India movement were all started under his leadership.

One of the greatest Indian freedom fighters that history witnessed was none other than Subhas Chandra Bose. He was born on 23rd January 1897. He was a radical nationalist and his ultimate patriotism carved a hero out of him. Bose belonged to the extremist section of the Indian freedom fighters. He was the leader of a radical youth wing of Congress from the early years of the 1920s till the end of 1930. Bose disagreed with the ideals of non-violence promoted by Gandhi, instead of believing that only armed revolt could oust the British from India. The founder of the Forward Bloc, he escaped the eyes of the British to ultimately reach Germany during the second world war. He raised the Indian National Army (INA) and with Japanese help, was able to free a portion of Indian territory from the British in Manipur, but was ultimately defeated due to Japanese surrender to the British. Although he is believed to have died in a plane crash in 1945, his death remains shrouded in mystery to date.

    Born: 23 January 1897, Cuttack
    Famously Known As Netaji

Mangal Pandey, a well-known Indian freedom fighter, is usually recognized as the forerunner of the 1857 revolt against the British, which is regarded as India’s first battle of independence. As a soldier in the East India Company’s army’s 34th Bengal Native Infantry (BNI) regiment, he led the sepoy mutiny, which eventually led to the 1857 uprising. When a new Enfield rifle was launched in India in the mid-1850s, his biggest dispute with the business began. The rifle’s cartridges were rumored to be lubricated with animal fat, specifically cow and pig fat. As a result of the cartridges’ use, the Indian troops rebelled against the corporation since it violated their religious beliefs. Pandey and his fellow sepoys rose up in revolt against the British commanders on March 29, 1857, and even attempted to kill them. He was arrested and sentenced to death on April 18. However, anticipating a sepoy uprising, British officials executed him 10 days prematurely on April 8.

Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament from Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its National Democratic Alliance (NDA). He is also a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the first prime minister to have been born after India's independence in 1947 and the second prime minister not belonging to the Indian National Congress to have won two consecutive elections, as well as a majority in both terms in the Indian lower house of parliament.[3]

Born and raised in Vadnagar, a small town in northeastern Gujarat, Modi completed his secondary education there, and is said to have helped his father sell tea at the local railway station. He was introduced to the RSS at age eight.[4] Modi left home at age 18 soon after his marriage to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he abandoned and publicly acknowledged as his wife many decades later. Modi has asserted that he travelled around India for two years, visiting a number of religious centres. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of emergency declared by Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi country in 1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.[b]

Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots in which 1044 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim,[c] or otherwise criticised for its management of the crisis. The Supreme Court remarked that Narendra Modi was like a Modern-day Nero, looking the other way as innocent women and children were burning[13][14][15]. Senior police officer Sanjiv Bhatt and Shubhranshu Chaudhary, a BBC correspondent claimed to have attended a meeting at Narendra Modi's residence where the Gujarat Chief Minister said Hindus should be allowed to vent their anger against Muslims[16]. However a Special Investigation Team, appointed by the Supreme Court, cleared Modi of any charges.[d] His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise.[19] His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[e]

Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the Indian lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy; he has centralised power by abolishing the Planning Commission. He began a high-profile sanitation campaign, initiated a controversial demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws.
