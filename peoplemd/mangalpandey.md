Mangal Pandey, a well-known Indian freedom fighter, is usually recognized as the forerunner of the 1857 revolt against the British, which is regarded as India’s first battle of independence. As a soldier in the East India Company’s army’s 34th Bengal Native Infantry (BNI) regiment, he led the sepoy mutiny, which eventually led to the 1857 uprising. When a new Enfield rifle was launched in India in the mid-1850s, his biggest dispute with the business began. The rifle’s cartridges were rumored to be lubricated with animal fat, specifically cow and pig fat. As a result of the cartridges’ use, the Indian troops rebelled against the corporation since it violated their religious beliefs. Pandey and his fellow sepoys rose up in revolt against the British commanders on March 29, 1857, and even attempted to kill them. He was arrested and sentenced to death on April 18. However, anticipating a sepoy uprising, British officials executed him 10 days prematurely on April 8.
