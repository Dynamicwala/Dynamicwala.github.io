Balajirao Bhat, commonly known as Nana Sahib, was born in Bithoor (Kanpur District), Uttar Pradesh in May 1824. He was the eighth Peshwa of India’s Maratha Empire. After Shivaji’s reign, he was one of the most powerful kings and one of the most courageous Indian independence warriors in history. Balaji Bajirao was another name for him. When Chattrapati Shahu died in 1749, he left the Maratha Empire to the Peshwas. He did not have an heir to his realm, therefore he nominated the valiant Peshwas as his heir. Nana Sahib, as king of the Maratha Empire, made significant contributions to the development of Pune. During his rule, Poona was transformed from a small village to a metropolis. He redesigned the city by constructing new districts, temples, and bridges. Having said that, Sahib was a key contributor to the 1857 revolt, leading a group of enthusiastic rebels. He overran the British soldiers in Kanpur and endangered the British camp by murdering the survivors. However, after defeating Nana Saheb and his men, the British were able to retake Kanpur.
